# Work with us

Field designs and builds innovative solutions for improving child survival and access to health care in several African countries. Our small team works from Berlin, Germany and Abuja, Nigeria. Weâ€™re looking for engaged people to work with us on the software tools which power our projects. 

We believe that only diverse teams can build strong solutions to the often wicked problems that health systems in emerging contexts face. We believe people matter the most - those we work with and that we work for. We believe in the power of careful design, incorrigible curiosity, and respect for the challenges and contexts we engage to produce solutions that generate real, lasting value for the people and programs we serve.

If this sounds appealing to you we'd love to chat. **We're currently looking for**
