#Data Scientist

Field designs and builds innovative solutions for improving child survival and access to health care in several African countries. Our small team works from Berlin, Germany and Abuja, Nigeria. We’re looking for engaged people to work with us on the data which powers our projects.

We believe that only diverse teams can build strong solutions to the often wicked problems that health systems in emerging contexts face. We believe people matter the most - those we work with and that we work for. We believe in the power of careful design, incorrigible curiosity, and respect for the challenges and contexts we engage to produce solutions that generate real, lasting value for the people and programs we serve. 

##The Job
We’re looking for motivated data scientist to support our innovative health system support and transformation projects. You’ll help collect, investigate, model and analyse data from a variety of national health and logistics systems Field develops, to produce insights which will shape our products, and ultimately the public health field at large.

Your job will involve exploring data from operational systems for managerial and product development insights, responding to customer requests for specific data extracts, and investigating data quality issues alongside our program team to help identify and diagnose potential system problems and opportunities. You will be asked to develop basic models to support internal and external management and product development decisions, and will collaborate with our software development team in the development of analysis tools. You will be working closely with our software, design and health program teams to provide integrated work which can create real impact at a national and international scale.

This is initially a 12-month full time contract position.
