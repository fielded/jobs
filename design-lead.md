# Design Lead

[Field](http://www.field.partners) designs and builds innovative solutions for improving child survival and access to healthcare in several African countries. We’re looking for creative, curious and tenacious people to work with us creating design-driven solutions to shape health systems and fix markets failing people around the world. Our distributed team works from Berlin, London and Boston, with extended visits to Abuja, Nigeria, where we base design research and development from the ground, where the learnings are richest. 

We believe that only diverse teams can build strong solutions to the often wicked problems that health systems face. We believe people matter the most - those that we work with and that we work for. We believe in the power of careful design, incorrigible curiosity, and respect for the challenges and contexts we engage to produce solutions that generate real, lasting value for the people and programs we serve. 

## The Job
We’re looking for a design lead to help us build a unique approach to digital interaction catering to the billions of users coming online across the world's emerging markets, driving visual and interaction design for a family of web and mobile products for healthcare, health logistics and conservation. Our design lead will work closely with our developers, users and subject matter experts to investigate and synthesize requirements and opportunities, researching, designing and building comprehensive, beautiful solutions and the processes that help us reach them.

Day to day, our design lead will translate high-level requirements into structured interactions and intuitive, functional workflows, as well as design interfaces and methodologies for navigating complex information. They will assist with mockup and asset production, and basic front-end development where necessary, but prioritise development and stewardship of our design philosophy and processes, and their realisation in the products we serve. Ultimately, our design lead will help us push the boundaries of design as a practice, and refine it as a tool for social and economic empowerment. 

This is a full-time position, with frequent (but negotiable) travel requirements.
