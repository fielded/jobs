Your job will be to translate high-level requirements into interaction flows and intuitive, functional workflows, as well as design interfaces and methodologies for navigating complex information. You will lead the visual design of this product family, working closely with our business, operations, and health-systems experts, engineers, and users to develop the interfaces that translate best practices into appealing, intuitive, and valuable user experiences.

Ultimately we need you to help us push the boundaries of UI/UX and make mobile a tool for social and economic empowerment. This is intended to be a full-time position.
