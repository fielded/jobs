# Product Manager

## Us
[Field](http://www.field.partners) designs and builds innovative solutions for improving child survival and access to healthcare in several African countries. We’re looking for creative, curious and tenacious people to work with us creating design-driven solutions to shape health systems and fix markets failing people around the world. Our distributed team works from Berlin, London and Boston, with extended visits to Abuja, Nigeria, where we base design research and development from the ground, where the learnings are richest. 

We believe that only diverse teams can build strong solutions to the often wicked problems that health systems face. We believe people matter the most - those that we work with and that we work for. We believe in the power of careful design, incorrigible curiosity, and respect for the challenges and contexts we engage to produce solutions that generate real, lasting value for the people and programs we serve. 

## You
We’re looking for a product manager to help us plan, design, build, and ship our family of web and mobile products for healthcare, health logistics and conservation. Our product manager defines, refines and advocates for each of the system-changing products in their portfolio, interrogating and extracting stakeholder requirements, guiding our technical teams in product creation and delivery,  safeguarding and critically evaluating product placement. Our product manager will have a deep curiosity about the contexts in which we develop solutions, paired with a high degree of creativity and fluency with a range of quantitative methods for design research and product development.

Day to day, our product manager will work with our technical team to decompose high-level product design into structured technical requirements for implementation, liaise with clients to ensure ongoing product relevance, decompose and analyse complex data requirements, and define, conduct and analyse research to manage product performance and high level strategy. Ultimately, our product manager will help us push the boundaries of technological intervention in complex systems, and build our product suite as a platform for social and economic empowerment. 

This is a full-time position, with frequent (but negotiable) travel requirements.
